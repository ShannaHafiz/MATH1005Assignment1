## Initial Data Analysis (IDA)

RStudio has many data sets already loaded in. The example below uses preloaded data direct from RStudio example dataset: mtcars.

Read about the [mtcars data set](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html).

In the rmd file, you will see how you can load your own dataset from either 1) an online source using a URL or 2) a local file on your own computer.

```{r}

# LOAD DATA v1 - uncomment the link below to: load data direct from html
#cars = read.csv("dataset URL")

# LOAD DATA v2 - uncomment the link below to: load data from local file
#cars = read.csv("dataset file location")

# Quick look at top 5 rows of data
head(mtcars)

## Size of data
dim(mtcars)

## R's classification of data
class(mtcars)

## R's classification of variables
str(mtcars)
#sapply(mtcars, class)
```
